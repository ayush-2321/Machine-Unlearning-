# Machine-Unlearning-
Machine Unlearning in deep neural networks is
the process of ’removing’ information from a
trained model. Unlearning is crucial for addressing biases, resolving confusion, upholding user
privacy and in various other aspects of model improvement and ethical AI. In this project we look
at some of the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms like SCRUB. This project presents a novel
approach within the SCRUB framework, introducing feature-based distillation as an alternative to
the existing response-based distillation. Additionally, we use saliency maps to gain insights into
the process of unlearning and also understand the
impact of unlearning on model behaviour.
